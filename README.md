# BDIX Bypass Service on OpenWRT Router

BDIX bypass is becoming increasingly popular in Bangladesh, especially in both rural and urban areas. Socks5 is one of the most widely used proxy protocols here.

### Can we use a Socks5 proxy on an OpenWRT router?
Yes! We can configure a Socks5 proxy on an OpenWRT router using **Redsocks**. I have customized Redsocks as **BDIX**, specifically for BDIX proxy users. However, there are very few tutorials available on setting up a Socks5 proxy on an OpenWRT router.

This tutorial will guide you through the installation and configuration process, making it easy to set up on your OpenWRT router.
